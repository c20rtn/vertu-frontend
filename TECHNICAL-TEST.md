# Technical Test

The purpose of this technical test is to evaluate how well a frontend developer candidate can break down a professional design file and translate it into HTML, CSS, and JS.

The professional design file is provided below. Candidates are encouraged to accomplish the designs to the following criteria:

1. Where possible, please provide us with access to the source code (e.g., a GitHub link).
2. If possible, please provide us with a link where we can view your work.
3. Most importantly, do not use frameworks. We want to evaluate your understandings of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JS.
